			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Set up Grafana Dashboard Integration",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Grafana dashboard integration task into smaller, more manageable subtasks. Consider separating the installation, data source configuration, initial dashboard creation for each metric (CPU, memory, disk I/O, network), and template implementation into distinct subtasks.",
			"reasoning": "Requires familiarity with Grafana and Prometheus. Involves multiple steps and potential configuration issues. Dashboard templates add complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Threshold-Based Alerting System",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose the alerting system implementation into subtasks for defining the data structure, implementing the alert engine core logic, integrating with each notification channel (email, Slack, Discord) separately, implementing alert history, and adding configuration options.",
			"reasoning": "Involves designing a system, implementing complex logic, and integrating with multiple external services. Alert history adds persistence requirements."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate with Time-Series Database (InfluxDB/TimescaleDB)",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the time-series database integration into subtasks for database selection, data ingestion implementation, configuration of retention policies, implementation of data compression, and performance testing of data ingestion and querying.",
			"reasoning": "Requires choosing and configuring a database, implementing data ingestion, and managing storage. Data compression adds algorithmic complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Implement API Authentication and Authorization",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the API security implementation into subtasks for implementing authentication (JWT/OAuth), RBAC, API key management, ACLs, and thorough testing of each security mechanism.",
			"reasoning": "Requires deep understanding of security principles and implementation of multiple security mechanisms. RBAC and ACLs add significant complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Centralized Agent Management",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose the agent management system into subtasks for designing the architecture, implementing the agent registration endpoint, implementing agent status monitoring, implementing automatic agent registration, and creating a UI for managing agents.",
			"reasoning": "Involves designing a distributed system, implementing communication between agents and the central management system, and managing agent state."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Optimize Data Collection Performance",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the performance optimization task into subtasks for implementing asynchronous data collection, optimizing memory usage, optimizing CPU usage, implementing caching strategies, and benchmarking performance before and after each optimization.",
			"reasoning": "Requires profiling and optimizing code, understanding concurrency, and implementing caching strategies. Performance optimization can be iterative and time-consuming."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Horizontal Scaling and Load Balancing",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the scaling and load balancing implementation into subtasks for implementing load balancing, implementing clustering support, configuring the load balancer, implementing automatic failover, and testing the system under load.",
			"reasoning": "Requires understanding of distributed systems, load balancing algorithms, and clustering technologies. Failover mechanisms add complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Comprehensive API Documentation",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose the API documentation task into subtasks for choosing a documentation tool, documenting API endpoints, generating documentation from code annotations, and creating examples and tutorials.",
			"reasoning": "Straightforward task, but requires attention to detail and thoroughness. Automation can simplify the process."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Audit Logging",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the audit logging implementation into subtasks for defining the data structure, implementing logging for user actions, implementing logging for system events, storing audit logs securely, and implementing a search and analysis mechanism.",
			"reasoning": "Requires defining a data structure, implementing logging logic, and ensuring data security. Search and analysis functionality adds complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Mobile-Responsive Dashboard",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the mobile responsiveness task into subtasks for configuring dashboards for responsiveness, testing on various devices, optimizing for mobile performance, and ensuring feature parity on mobile.",
			"reasoning": "Relatively straightforward if Grafana supports responsive design. Requires testing on different devices and browsers."
